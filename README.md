# EmployeeArrayPrintingApp
This app is an Object oriented programing (OOP) project made for a class in  college. The professor wanted to know where we were in terms of OOP and 
gave us this asignment where we had to calculate te hourly payrate and sales payrate of different employees while also testing the app for bugs 
and case testing using JUnit Case testing.
